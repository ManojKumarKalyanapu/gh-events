1. Events — What Triggers a Workflow?
Events are specific activities in a GitHub repository that trigger workflows.

Common Events:
Event	Triggered When
push: A commit is pushed to a branch.
pull_request: A pull request is opened, synced, reopened, or closed.
issues: An issue is opened, edited, closed, etc.
release: A release is created, edited, or deleted.
workflow_dispatch: A workflow is manually triggered.
schedule: Triggered on a time schedule (cron).
workflow_run: Triggered after another workflow finishes.

2. Activity Types (for events):
Some events support activity types to fine-tune when a workflow runs.
Example: pull_request Activity Types
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, closed, synchronize]

Activity-Type	Description
opened: When PR is created.
closed: When PR is closed (merged or not).
reopened: When PR is reopened.
synchronize: When a commit is pushed to the PR branch.
assigned, unassigned, labeled, unlabeled, etc.: For PR or issue changes.

3. Filters — Run Workflows Conditionally
A. Branch Filters
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, dev]

B. Tag Filters
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']

C. Path Filters (Only run if certain files change)
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'src/**'
      - '!docs/**'   # ignore changes in docs folder


4. if: Condition (Per step or job)
You can add an if: to run a step/job conditionally based on context.
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run only on main branch
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: echo "Running on main"
