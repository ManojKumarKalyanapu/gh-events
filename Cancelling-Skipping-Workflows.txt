1. Cancelling Workflows

A. Manual Cancellation
You can manually cancel a running workflow from the GitHub Actions tab:
Actions → Click on a running workflow → “Cancel workflow” button.

B. Auto-Cancel Previous Runs
Use the concurrency key to cancel in-progress workflows for the same branch or key.
example:
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

| Key                  | Description                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `group`              | A unique identifier (often workflow + branch).         |
| `cancel-in-progress` | Automatically cancels previous runs in the same group. |


2. Skipping Workflows
A. Using Git Commit Message
If your commit message includes the text:
[skip ci]

or 

[ci skip]

GitHub will not run the workflow.
Works only with events like push.

B. Using Conditional Logic with if:
Skip jobs or steps based on condition.

example:
jobs:
  deploy:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

or 

if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip deploy]')

C. Use Inputs to Skip in workflow_dispatch
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      run-deploy:
        description: 'Run deployment?'
        required: true
        default: 'yes'

jobs:
  deploy:
    if: ${{ github.event.inputs.run-deploy == 'yes' }}

D. Skip Based on File Changes (paths-ignore)
on:
  push:
    paths-ignore:
      - '**.md'
      - 'docs/**'
Skips workflow if only those files change.

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Manual Cancel                | From Actions tab                   | Stop a running workflow        |
| `concurrency`                | Auto-cancels in-progress workflows | Avoid duplicated runs          |
| `[skip ci]`                  | Skip workflow by commit message    | No CI run needed               |
| `if:` condition              | Control job/step execution         | Conditional logic              |
| `paths-ignore`               | Skip based on changed files        | Only trigger on relevant files |
| `workflow_dispatch` + inputs | Let user decide to run/skip        | Manual skip via input form     |
